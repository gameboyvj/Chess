Chess
=====
Classic game of Chess played with command line

The project was written as an exercise in pair programming. It uses inheritance to define each of the chess pieces. A major goal of the application was to make sure it takes into account any mistake a player makes. Therefore, the code checks for any invalid moves the player can make from choosing the wrong piece to accidently putting his/her own king in check. The board is rendered every turn with the up to date pieces and each position is clearly labeled to avoid any confusion.

One of the best implemented features is to duplicate the board on the backend to see if the move puts the player in check. The game then alerts you of an invalid move and lets you move again.
